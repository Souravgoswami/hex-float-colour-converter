# Hex Float Colour Converter ![icon](https://github.com/Souravgoswami/hex-float-colour-converter/blob/master/hex%20float%20color%20converter/images/icon.png)
Convert Hex colours to float colours and vice versa.

## Running Hex Float Colour Converter 🏃‍♀🏃
+ You need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Ruby2D](http://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started/) installed on your system.

+ Download the [source code as zip file](https://github.com/Souravgoswami/hex-float-colour-converter/archive/master.zip) or clone this repository to save the source codes and included files.

+ Extract the zip file.

+ Run the `main.rb` file with Ruby interpreter.

## Usage ❓
Running the [main.rb](https://github.com/Souravgoswami/hex-float-colour-converter/blob/master/hex%20float%20color%20converter/main.rb) will bring up a window. You can type a hex value on the top box, or you can type floating RGB value in the boxes on the 2nd row. The bg will change accordingly.

### Typing 👨‍💻👩‍💻
Note that, on the Floating RGB boxes, you can't type a value more than 1. You can type 0.01234 but not 1.0001 - which will reset the value to 1.

You can't type any letter on the hex box. The hex box will only accept input from 0 to 9 and a to f.

### Keys ⌨️
+ Backspace to clear the last character of the colour.
+ Escape / P / Q Exits the colour converter.
+ R selects a random colour.
+ S saves the current colour to a file.
+ T clears the current colour.

### Mouse 🐭
Hovering the mouse either on the hex box or on the RGB boxes will let you type in the box.

### On-Screen Buttons 🗔
To press on the on-screen buttons, you can left click, middle click or right click your mouse. The available buttons are:
+ Clear will clear the current colour (equivalent to pressing T).
+ Random! will give you another random colour (equivalent to pressing R).
+ Save will save your current colour to a file (equivalent to pressing S).
+ Exit will simply exit the app (equivalent to pressing Escape / P / Q).
